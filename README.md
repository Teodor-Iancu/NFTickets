## Features
**Before purchase:**
- The price. Each Badge/NFT can bring you a discount of a few accumulated percentages. e.g. Holder, Stacker, Diamond hands, DoerNFT, etc
- Possibility to reserve a seat in the VIP area.
- Whitelisting, the possibility of having a time window (e.g. 72 hours) before the accessibility of public purchases

**Before the event**
- Access and validation of presence via QR-Code from any device

**After the event**
- Proof of participation (the idea can also be extended to IRLMs)
- Qualification for different types of preselections (airdrops, certain positions/facilities)

The major difference is given by the fact that in web2 qualification, confirmation is only possible based on centralized checks/recommendations related to the human factor, in Web3 these become obsolete, which is why we can say that an NFT is not a simple jpeg :)
